# CompanySite — TODO

**Cold-start rule:** a fresh session should read this file and be productive in 60 seconds.

---

## NEXT ACTION

Two open lanes — pick one:

**A. Deploy (money-path opens).** Cloudflare Pages: connect repo → root dir `CompanySite` → build `npm run build` → output `dist` → set `RESEND_API_KEY` env var → attach `m3mm.net`. Blocker between hardened code and a working intake in production.

**B. Ladder RUNG 2 — TEST.** Unit tests on `functions/_lib/validate.ts` + `functions/_lib/rate.ts` (already extracted for this reason). Add vitest to devDeps, one spec per exported function, run in CI. Should be ~1 hour of work; unlocks confident refactors.

Recommended: A. Money path first, tests second — the site does zero business sitting on my laptop.

## SHIPPED (2026-07-05, session 2 continuation)

- **Ladder Rung 1 (HARDEN) complete.** Rewrote `functions/api/lead.ts` with body cap, Content-Type gate, Origin allowlist, per-IP rate limit with `Retry-After`, Resend fetch timeout, structured `errors[]`, URL protocol allowlist. Same treatment on `/api/track` (4 KB cap, 60/min rate, silent 204 on junk). Extracted pure helpers to `functions/_lib/validate.ts` + `functions/_lib/rate.ts` so Rung 2 (TEST) can unit-test without a CF runtime. Verified via 9-check wrangler smoke matrix. Commit `4293feb`.
- Committed the whole 2026-07-05 rebuild in 4 clean chunks: `7b2704a` build scaffold · `328f1f1` Astro source · `4afe796` functions · `0f41776` docs + Dockerfile + legacy move + per-project meta files.

## SHIPPED (2026-07-05)

- Full Astro 4 + Tailwind 3 + Cloudflare Pages rebuild landed. Previous single-file cyberpunk site preserved at `legacy/2026-cyberpunk-index.html`.
- Homepage: editorial-scale hero with drawn neon underline + client marquee + authority stat block; Proof section with per-client SVG art (Aries deck geometry, Big 7 BUILD/FIX split); Services as editorial numbered rows with per-service accent (clay / neon / cyber); Intake with corner brackets, numbered fields, animated submit.
- `/audit` landing page for TikTok bio, tagged `source=audit-page`.
- Cloudflare Pages Functions: `/api/lead` (Resend + validation + honeypot + rate-limit) and `/api/track` (CTA beacon).
- 14+ CTAs wired to `[data-cta]` global tracker; IntersectionObserver scroll reveals; `prefers-reduced-motion` respected.
- Wire weight: **~10 KB HTML + ~6 KB CSS gzipped, zero JS bundles.**
- Verified end-to-end via `wrangler pages dev`: valid POST → 200, invalid → 400 with field list, honeypot → 200 silent, GET → 405, rate limit trips at 6th hit inside 60s, `/review` `/free-review` `/site-review` → 301 `/audit`.

## PARKED

- Case-study MP4s: drop `public/videos/{aries,big7}-scroll.mp4` + posters, uncomment `video`/`poster` fields in `src/content/caseStudies/*.md`. Michael's ClipForge output goes here.
- Add a real testimonial from David Serrano (Aries client) once approved.
- Metrics / results ribbon under hero (parked from quality pass — is a section addition, not craft).
- FAQ section (parked; section addition).
- About/founder block (parked; section addition).
- Sitemap generation (`@astrojs/sitemap` integration + reintroduce `Sitemap:` line in `robots.txt`).
- Self-host fonts to shave the last font-download from Google (Lighthouse `preload-webfonts` win).

## QUESTIONS FOR MIKE

1. Deploy target confirmed as **m3mm.net on Cloudflare Pages**? (previous was Railway, memory says Railway-first per D-001 — Cloudflare Pages is the correct call for static + Pages Functions but wants confirming)
2. Sender identity for Resend — verified domain `hello@m3mm.net` or leave on Resend sandbox for the first week?
3. Want the fleet-status prior Railway URL kept alive as a redirect once m3mm.net is live, or let it die?
